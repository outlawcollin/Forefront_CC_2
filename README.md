# Forefront Codeless Conduct Bounty 2

## 1. Introduction

I am very new to designing Discord stickers so I would like to take up the challenge of designing simple stickers for Forefront
so that not only would I be contributing to Forefront, I would also know how my stickers would look like when implemented in
Forefront Discord and continue to improve on my sticker designing in the future.

All of the designs are done by me and MS Paint and [photoshop](https://www.photopea.com/) was used in designing the images.
